## Introduction

The Horse Riding Lessons booking system allows users to book horse riding lessons. The user can set up a personal account by signing up to the site. When they are signed up they can login to their account to book a lesson. They can choose a date and time, whether they want the lesson indoor or outdoor, their level of experience and the horse they want for the lesson. When they book a lesson they can choose to edit the booking to make changes to it or they can delete the booking. There is a seperate page showing all the horse available and their details. The user can also see the three most popular horses on the Home page.
